# Smart Farm 
Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a countryâ€™s economic growth.
In a country like India, the majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.

Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.
In this project, we are presenting a website in which the following applications are implemented; Crop recommendation, Fertilizer recommendation and Plant disease prediction, respectively.
